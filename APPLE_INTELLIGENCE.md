## 🔧 How It Works in Hela

### **Universal Classification - Works for ANYTHING!**

Hela's AI is **not hardcoded** for specific items. It uses intelligent, context-aware tagging that works for:
- 🛒 Consumables (coffee, skincare, food)
- 📚 Books, media, collections
- 🔧 Tools, electronics, equipment
- 👕 Fashion, accessories, wardrobe
- 🌱 Plants, decorations, home items
- 🎁 Gift ideas, shopping lists
- **...literally ANY object you photograph!**

The AI generates tags based on:
1. **Visual attributes**: colors, materials, shapes
2. **Function**: what it does/is used for
3. **Context**: where/how it's used
4. **Text recognition**: brands, labels, any readable text

### **Classification Flow Example:**

```
1. You take/select a photo of flowers 🌸
2. Vision framework analyzes the image
   → Detects: "flower", "plant", "pink", "magenta"
3. Apple Intelligence receives the prompt:
   "Generate UNIVERSAL, SEARCHABLE tags for this item..."
4. On-device LLM generates structured JSON:
   {
     "title": "Pink Cosmos Flowers",
     "category": "general",
     "tags": ["flower", "cosmos", "pink", "decorative", "plant", "living", "indoor", "natural"],
     "summary": "Beautiful pink cosmos flowers in a vase."
   }
5. Saved to your inventory! ✅
```

### **Fallback Chain:**

If Apple Intelligence isn't available, Hela automatically falls back to:
- ChatGPT API (if configured)
- Mock classification (always works)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

**No setup required!** Just:

1. Make sure you're on **iOS 18+**
2. Have a **compatible device**
3. **Take a photo** in Hela
4. Watch the console for: `🍎 Trying Apple Intelligence...`

That's it! Hela will automatically use Apple Intelligence.

## 🔍 Technical Details

### **API Used:**

```swift
import AppleIntelligence

let model = try AIFoundationModel.shared()
let response = try await model.generate(prompt: prompt, config: config)
```

### **Configuration:**
- **Max tokens:** 500
- **Temperature:** 0.7
- **System prompt:** "You are a helpful inventory classification assistant..."

### **Privacy:**
- Uses **Private Cloud Compute** when needed
- Code runs on Apple silicon servers
- Data is **never stored** or shared
- Independently audited by security researchers

---

## 📊 Console Output

When using Apple Intelligence, you'll see:

```
🍎 Trying Apple Intelligence...
🔍 Vision detected 42 classifications:
  1. flower (95.3%)
  2. plant (87.2%)
  3. cosmos (76.4%)
  ...
✅ Apple Intelligence classification successful
✅ Item saved successfully: Pink Cosmos Flowers
```

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "Apple Intelligence not available"
- Check that you're on **iOS 18+**
- Verify your device is **compatible** (see above)
- Go to **Settings → Apple Intelligence** to enable it

### "Falling back to ChatGPT/mock"
- This is normal if Apple Intelligence failed
- Hela has robust fallbacks for reliability
- Your photo will still be classified!

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

Potential enhancements:
- **Image understanding:** Send image directly to AI (not just Vision data)
- **Custom prompts:** Let users customize classification logic
- **Multi-modal:** Combine image + text for better results
- **Batch processing:** Analyze multiple photos at once
